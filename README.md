# Facebook-image-share
Chrome extension - right click on an image for FB share option

Adds an option to the right-click context menu when clicking on an image.

It redirects to the Facebook sharing page with the image ready to be shared.

Issues:

The inspect views option in the extenions tab will sometimes show an error that does not seem to impact functionality.

Image preview will not always apear on the share page.
